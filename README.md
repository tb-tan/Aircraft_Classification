# Aircraft_Classification

This repository contains the source code and documentation for the thesis project "Impact of Metadata on Civil and Military Aircraft Classification in Satellite Imagery: A Multi-Modal Framework with YOLO and XGBoost", submitted to Tilburg University.

This thesis explores improving aircraft classification in satellite imagery by combining deep learning with structured metadata. A two-phase pipeline integrates YOLO-based object detection and feature extraction with an XGBoost classifier. Using the RarePlanes dataset, the study compares YOLO11 and YOLO12 models across scenarios with and without geometric metadata. Results show that fusing visual features with metadata boosts classification accuracy, especially for underrepresented military aircraft. The research demonstrates the value of multi-modal approaches for more interpretable and effective satellite-based aircraft recognition.
